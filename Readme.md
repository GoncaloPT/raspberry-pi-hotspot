# Pi4 Hotspot

The purpose of this project is to hold all the assets ( information + code ) required to have a raspberry pi 4 as hotspot. The internet source will be a free internet like fonzon or meo wifi.

## Requirements

### Raspberry PI4

A raspberry pi model 4 is the tested platform. With this being said, it might work in other environemnts.
The pi is expected to have ubuntu 20 installed.

### USB WIFI ADAPTER
The pi4 has builtin wifi. This builtin wifi is a supported by a single adapter. This means that the built-in adapter only supports 1 network. 
Since we need 2 networks ( connect to the internet gatway network and create a hotspot network ) a USB wifi adapter is required
